        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
